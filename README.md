# Greenhouse Gas ETL Project

## Exploring Agricultural Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions

This project was developed as part of the Methods of Advanced Data Engineering course at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU). It investigates how crop production influences greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over the last 30 years (1990–2020), focusing on major crop-producing countries (USA, China, India) and global trends.

An end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline was built using Python and Jupyter Notebooks to collect, clean, transform, and analyze environmental datasets. The project aims to answer:

> **How does crop production influence greenhouse gas emissions?**

Key features:
- Comprehensive data engineering workflow
- Analysis of agricultural impacts on GHG emissions
- Automation and reproducibility using Python and Jupyter
- Focus on sustainability and data-driven reporting

For detailed findings, please see the [analysis report](project/analysis-report.pdf).
