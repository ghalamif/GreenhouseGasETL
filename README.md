# Exploring Agricultural Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions #

Agriculture is essential for feeding the world's population and supporting economies.  It provides some benefits but also accounts for massive greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that accelerate global warming. The three largest crop producers worldwide, the USA, China, and India, also consume a lot of agricultural land whose productive practices have highly significant environmental effects. 
This work will attempt to understand how crop production and greenhouse gas emissions are related in these countries -and globally over 30 years (1990-2020). This project is gone answer this question: 
How does crop production influence greenhouse gas emissions? 



# Project Plan

## Title
Exploring Agricultural Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions in India, USA, China, and the World (1990-2020)
## Main Question
1- How does crop production in the World and these (China, India, USA) countries influence greenhouse gas emissions?


## Description
This project aims to explore the relationship between crop production and GHG emissions in the World, China, India, USA over the period from 1990 to 2020. By analyzing historical data on crop yields and GHG emission, we will investigate how agricultural practices contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
