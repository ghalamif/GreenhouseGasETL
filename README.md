# Exploring Agricultural Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions #

Agriculture is essential for feeding the world's population and supporting economies.  It provides some benefits but also accounts for massive greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that accelerate global warming. The three largest crop producers worldwide, the USA, China, and India, also consume a lot of agricultural land whose productive practices have highly significant environmental effects. 
This work will attempt to understand how crop production and greenhouse gas emissions are related in these countries -and globally over 30 years (1990-2020). This project is gone answer this question: 
How does crop production influence greenhouse gas emissions?
